# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The program is a banking app that allows users to see their investment portfolo and projected gains according to a monthly deposit and intial funds 
  
What did you do particularly well?
  The code written to display the menu screen i enjoyed doing beause you an tell what the program is supposed to display
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  The user input, i couldn't seem to get it right on this one.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Looking back at the program it looks like  i submitted it without anyway to read the user input. Resources that ould be used to orret this issue are the chapters work   from class and stack overflow
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects?
  The manipulation of files in ths manner was fairly new to me, it will be really useful in future classes that involve bigger projects
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I seperated the function into seperate classes and noted the funtions of each one. If there is a particular function that needs to be changed it can easily be identfifed.
